# content_randomizer

`content_randomizer` is a TYPO3 extension to show random tt_content records in frontend.
Please select all tt_content records in group field of the plugin and
`content_randomizer` will choose a content element to show in frontend.

Currently, the output is un-cached, but we have ideas how to prevent that in future ;-)
